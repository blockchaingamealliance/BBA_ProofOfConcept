This sub-repository should contain all the libraries created for an easy implementation of BBAs.

Different projects, that aim:
-> Implementation in one language BBA
-> create, sign, visualize (SDK)

In order to do that:
* BBA_Creator (along with BBA_Signer in the same lib)
* BBA_Viewer (along with BBA_Sign_Checker in the same lib)
